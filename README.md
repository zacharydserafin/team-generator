## <a id="description"></a>Description 

The goal of this project was to utilize OOP and TDD to dynamically generate a website that displays information about a project's team members aquired via user input.

## <a id="install"></a>Installation 

Run 'npm install' from the command line once in the project directory to install the required dependencies.

## <a id="usage"></a>Usage Instructions 

Once all dependencies are installed, run 'node index' to begin the program. Then, answer all of the prompts carefully. If your input does not match what the program is expecting, it will throw an error and you will have to start over. Be sure to only input positive integers when asked for numbers, and provide your email addresses in a valid email format.
